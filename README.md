Ok, let's do this self-reflection. In this project, I'm going to put into practice the basic foundations of The Odin Project course. I will use some HTML to create my first website.

To be successful in this project, I will need to create an HTML page with the following elements:

A full <head> and <body> structure
The use of <p>, <img>, ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists
Relative and absolute URLs
Additionally, I'm going to use Git for version control in this project.
