    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>The cachito</strong> is a soft, savory bread from Venezuela, traditionally filled with ham and, in some variations, cheese or bacon.
             Its dough has a slight sweetness and is baked until golden and fluffy.
             It is a popular choice for breakfast or a snack, often enjoyed with coffee or juice.
        </p>
        <p>
            This bread is the Venezuelan version of stuffed croissants and is commonly found in bakeries across the country. The balance between the dough's
             sweetness and the savory filling makes it a favorite for many. Homemade versions allow for customization with different ingredients.
