    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Paneton</strong>, also known as panetón, is a sweet bread of Italian origin, traditionally enjoyed during Christmas and New Year's celebrations.
            Its dough is light and fluffy, with a slightly sweet taste and a soft texture. 
            It is typically filled with candied fruits and raisins, though variations with chocolate chips or nuts also exist.

            This bread has transcended Italy's borders and is especially popular in countries like Peru, 
            where it has become a holiday staple. Its preparation is a long process that includes extended fermentation
            to achieve its signature height and flavor.
            It is often enjoyed with hot chocolate, coffee, or simply on its own.
